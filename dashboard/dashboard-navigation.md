## Pretty simple.

I tried to keep the navigation bar as simple as possible, but at the same time keeping it as informational as possible.

## Here's what it usually looks like.

The Configuration, Broadcast Messages, Commands . . . are navigation links, those navigate you throughout your dashboard. 

Hovering over one of them will make the one selected have a blue underline. Like this.

And that's all! Its that simple!
